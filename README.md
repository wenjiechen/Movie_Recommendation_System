Recommender systems, which can help customers to find potential preference, have been successfully applied in e-commerce web sites, such as Amazon and Netflix.
In this lab, we implemented Collaborative Filtering using Mahout and Python respectively, and used `Movie Lens dataset` to test and training.CF algorithms calculate similarities among users and items based on usersâ€™ rating history, and recommend the top-N similar items.
